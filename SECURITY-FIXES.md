# Security Fixes Applied

This document tracks the security improvements made to address code scanning alerts.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CDN Integrity Checks (Alert #66)
**File:** `views/partials/footer.ejs`
**Issue:** Script loaded from CDN without integrity check
**Fix:** Added subresource integrity (SRI) hashes and proper CORS settings to external scripts:
- Bootstrap 5.1.3: Added integrity hash and crossorigin attribute
- zxcvbn password library: Added integrity hash, crossorigin, and referrerpolicy

### 2. Clear-text Logging of Sensitive Information (Alert #60)
**File:** `scripts/test-warehouse.js`
**Issue:** Database configuration with password was being logged in clear text
**Fix:** Modified logging to exclude sensitive information like passwords. Only log safe configuration fields.

### 3. Missing Rate Limiting for File System Access (Alert #56)
**File:** `server.js`
**Issue:** Static file routes (favicon, etc.) were not rate-limited
**Fix:** 
- Applied general rate limiter to favicon route specifically
- Moved rate limiting middleware to be applied earlier in the middleware stack
- Removed duplicate rate limiter application

### 4. DOM XSS Vulnerabilities (Alerts #55 & #54)
**File:** `views/qrcode-generator.ejs`
**Issue:** User-controlled content was being inserted via innerHTML, creating XSS risk
**Fix:** Replaced innerHTML usage with safe DOM methods:
- Created elements using `document.createElement()`
- Set text content using `textContent` instead of innerHTML
- Properly escaped user data to prevent script injection

### 5. CSRF Protection Enhancement (Alert #53)
**File:** `server.js`
**Issue:** CSRF error handler was not properly applied
**Fix:** Added CSRF error handler to the middleware chain before general error handling

## Security Measures Now in Place

1. **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** All external CDN resources now have integrity checks
2. **Safe Logging:** Sensitive configuration data is filtered before logging
3. **Rate Limiting:** All routes including static file access are rate-limited
4. **XSS Prevention:** DOM manipulation uses safe methods that prevent script injection
5. **CSRF Protection:** Complete CSRF protection with proper error handling

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Regular Security Audits:** Run code scanning tools regularly
2. **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Safe DOM Manipulation:** Prefer `textContent` and `createElement` over `innerHTML`
4. **Logging Best Practices:** Never log sensitive information like passwords or tokens
5. **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies updated and use tools like `npm audit`

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ Test all CDN resources load correctly with integrity checks
2. ✅ Verify rate limiting is working on all endpoints
3. ✅ Test CSRF protection on form submissions
4. ✅ Ensure no sensitive data appears in logs
5. ✅ Verify XSS prevention in user input fields

**Status: All security fixes have been successfully applied and validated**

## Security Monitoring

Continue monitoring for:
- Failed CSRF token validations
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious user input patterns
- Authentication anomalies
